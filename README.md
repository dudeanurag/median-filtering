# median-filtering
A Java application that implements median filtering
-- It provides an interface window, where we can input an image by the click of a button.
-- The User can also insert Gaussian noise to the image, which is then displayed separately.
-- The user can customize the amount of noise by defining mean and variance of white gaussian noise.
-- Median Filtering can then be applied to the noisy image.
-- The size of the Median filter can also be defined.
